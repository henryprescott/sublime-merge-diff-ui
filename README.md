Simple UI to allow sublime merge to diff stand alone files

Always found the Perforce P4Merge tool hugely useful, after trying Sublime Merge recently, I just wanted to throw something together to match the functionality I missed.

Known Issues:
* Drag & drop doesn't go into correct input when UI is a background window (so most cases).
* Input caret does not move to end of text input area when drag & dropping or browsing for a file.
